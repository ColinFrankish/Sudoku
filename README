SUDOKU
The goal of Sudoku is to fill every box in the entire
nine by nine grid with numbers. Everyt column, row and 
3x3 box within the grid must contaib the numbers 1 to 9
. Each number can only occur once within each scenario. 

The program must be able to analyse all possible 
combinations to work out what number must go in each
cell. 

We are developing an algorythmn to solve a simple 
Sudoku. 

Here we go!
